TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
1.) Change folder "MEAN project" to whatever you want your project to be called
2.) Change the "name" field at the tops of 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' to whatever
    you named your folder to in step 1
3.) Follow the instructions in the comments on all the files in subdirectories in 'server' so your DB and Schema names are correct.
4.) Open your preferred terminal, navigate to the project folder and type 'npm install'
5.) Done!

Notes:

-body-parser
-express
-express-flash
-express-session
