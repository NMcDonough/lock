    I began this webpage and the games presented with a vague idea of a wonderful video game and no idea how to make it. Armed with only a basic knowledge of how to make a full stack application and a tutorial from <a target="_blank" href="http://phaser.io">Phaser.io</a>. I started with <a [routerLink]="['/phaser-game']">Phaser Game</a>, based on the tutorial, and progressed from there.
